# Trello Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the complete Trello Implementation Plan for Advanced Analytics with LLM Queries. This implementation enables sophisticated cross-platform insights by establishing relationships between Trello cards, Google Drive files, and Gmail messages.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Database Schema Extensions

#### ✅ New Relationship Tables Added

**TrelloCardFileLink Table:**
- Links Trello cards to Google Drive files
- Fields: `id`, `card_id`, `file_id`, `link_type`, `created_at`, `created_by`
- Link types: 'attachment', 'reference', 'requirement', 'deliverable'
- Unique constraint on `card_id` + `file_id`
- Proper indexing for performance

**TrelloCardEmailLink Table:**
- Links Trello cards to Gmail messages
- Fields: `id`, `card_id`, `email_id`, `link_type`, `created_at`, `created_by`
- Link types: 'discussion', 'update', 'notification', 'attachment'
- Unique constraint on `card_id` + `email_id`
- Proper indexing for performance

#### ✅ Updated Existing Models
- Added `file_links` relationship to `TrelloCard` model
- Added `email_links` relationship to `TrelloCard` model
- Added `card_links` relationship to `File` model
- Added `card_links` relationship to `Email` model

#### ✅ Database Migration
- Created and applied Prisma migration: `20250609193043_add_trello_card_links`
- All relationship tables created successfully
- Database schema updated and synchronized

### Phase 2: Link Detection Service

#### ✅ Core LinkDetectionService Implementation

**Text Pattern Recognition:**
- Trello card URL patterns: `https://trello.com/c/[cardId]`, `trello.com/c/[cardId]`
- Custom card ID patterns: `#[PROJECT-123]` format
- Google Drive file patterns: Google Docs, Sheets, Drive files, open URLs
- Robust regex patterns with deduplication

**Database Operations:**
- `findCardByTrelloId()` - Locate cards by Trello ID
- `findFileByGoogleId()` - Locate files by Google ID
- `linkCardToFile()` - Create card-file relationships
- `linkCardToEmail()` - Create card-email relationships
- Duplicate prevention and error handling

**Text Processing:**
- `processCardText()` - Extract file references from card content
- `processEmailText()` - Extract card references from email content
- `batchProcessCardsForFileReferences()` - Bulk processing for existing data

#### ✅ Enhanced Sync Operations

**Gmail Sync Enhancement:**
- Integrated link detection in `syncMessages.js`
- Automatically detects Trello card references in email content
- Creates card-email links during sync
- Added `linksCreated` to sync statistics

**Drive Sync Enhancement:**
- Integrated link detection in `syncFiles.js`
- Checks if files are referenced in Trello card descriptions
- Creates card-file links during sync
- Added `linksCreated` to sync statistics

**Trello Sync Enhancement:**
- Integrated link detection in `syncBoards.js`
- Detects file references in card descriptions
- Creates card-file links during sync
- Added `linksCreated` to sync statistics

### Phase 3: Manual Linking API

#### ✅ Complete API Endpoints

**Card-File Link Management:**
- `POST /api/links/card-file` - Create manual card-file links
- `DELETE /api/links/card-file/:cardId/:fileId` - Remove card-file links

**Card-Email Link Management:**
- `POST /api/links/card-email` - Create manual card-email links
- `DELETE /api/links/card-email/:cardId/:emailId` - Remove card-email links

**Link Retrieval:**
- `GET /api/links/card/:cardId` - Get all links for a specific card



#### ✅ Security & Validation
- User authentication required for all endpoints
- User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- Input validation for all parameters
- Proper error handling and responses

### Phase 4: LangChain Integration Update

#### ✅ Enhanced SQL Service

**Updated Schema Context:**
- Added `TrelloCardFileLink` and `TrelloCardEmailLink` to allowed tables
- Updated database schema documentation
- Added relationship table descriptions and usage examples

**Enhanced Query Examples:**
- Recently modified files linked to cards
- Task completion percentage with documents
- Overdue tasks with email activity
- Cross-platform analytics queries

**Security Updates:**
- Updated table access validation
- Enhanced SQL query patterns
- Added relationship-specific query examples

### Phase 5: Enhanced Data Retrieval

#### ✅ Improved Trello Card API

**Enhanced getBoardCards:**
- Includes linked files and emails in card responses
- Structured `linkedFiles` array with file metadata
- Structured `linkedEmails` array with email metadata
- Link type and creation timestamp information

**Response Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "card123",
  name: "Card Name",
  linkedFiles: [
    {
      id: "file1",
      name: "Document.pdf",
      fileType: "docs",
      linkType: "reference",
      linkedAt: "2025-06-09T..."
    }
  ],
  linkedEmails: [
    {
      id: "email1",
      subject: "Discussion",
      linkType: "discussion",
      linkedAt: "2025-06-09T..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation

#### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite

**LinkDetectionService Tests:**
- 18 test cases covering all functionality
- Pattern extraction validation
- Database operation testing
- Error handling verification
- Mock-based testing with Jest

**Test Coverage:**
- Text pattern recognition (Trello URLs, Google Drive URLs)
- Database lookup operations
- Link creation and deduplication

- Error handling and edge cases

## 🎯 Target Analytics Queries Now Supported

### 1. "Which Trello cards are linked to recently modified files?"
```sql
SELECT tc.name as card_name, f.name as file_name, f."modified_at"
FROM "TrelloCard" tc
JOIN "TrelloCardFileLink" tcfl ON tc.id = tcfl.card_id  
JOIN "File" f ON tcfl.file_id = f.id
WHERE f."modified_at" > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND tc."user_id" = 'userId'
ORDER BY f."modified_at" DESC;
```

### 2. "What percentage of tasks have corresponding documents?"
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT tc.id) as total_tasks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT tcfl.card_id) as tasks_with_docs,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT tcfl.card_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT tc.id), 2) as coverage_percentage
FROM "TrelloCard" tc
LEFT JOIN "TrelloCardFileLink" tcfl ON tc.id = tcfl.card_id
WHERE tc."user_id" = 'userId';
```

### 3. "Are there overdue tasks with active email conversations?"
```sql
SELECT tc.name, tc."due_date", COUNT(e.id) as recent_email_count
FROM "TrelloCard" tc
JOIN "TrelloCardEmailLink" tcel ON tc.id = tcel.card_id
JOIN "Email" e ON tcel.email_id = e.id  
WHERE tc."due_date" < NOW() 
  AND e."received_at" > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 days'
  AND tc."user_id" = 'userId'
GROUP BY tc.id, tc.name, tc."due_date"
ORDER BY recent_email_count DESC;
```
